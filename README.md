# Footswitch

Arduino program allowing digital or analog switches to control keyboard buttons. For example, you could use a piano sustain pedal to control a Shift key.

This project was built for the Arduino Pro Micro ATmega32U4, but it can be adapted to any board that supports the [keyboard](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/usb/keyboard/) library.

I personally use this for push-to-talk keys, as moving them off my keyboard/mouse and onto foot pedals is great for situations where your hands are both fully occupied.
